Autocomplete or word completion works so that when the writer writes the first letter or letters of a word, 
the program predicts one or more possible words as choices. 
If the word he intends to write is included in the list he can select it, 
for example by using the number keys. If the word that the user wants is not predicted, 
the writer must enter the next letter of the word. At this time, 
the word choice(s) is altered so that the words provided begin with the same letters as those that have been selected. 
When the word that the user wants appears it is selected, and the word is inserted into the text.
In another form of word prediction, words most likely to follow the just written one are predicted, 
based on recent word pairs used.Word prediction uses language modeling, 
where within a set vocabulary the words are most likely to occur are calculated.
Along with language modeling, basic word prediction on AAC devices is often coupled with a recency model, 
where words that are used more frequently by the AAC user are more likely to be predicted.
Word prediction software often also allows the user to enter their own words into the word prediction dictionaries either directly, or by "learning" words that have been written.
